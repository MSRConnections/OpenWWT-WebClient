# The AAS WorldWide Telescope Web Client

The “web client” of the [AAS](https://aas.org/)
[WorldWide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/home) (WWT) is a web
application that lets you explore the universe from the comfort of your chair.

### <https://worldwidetelescope.org/webclient/>

Learn more about WWT [here](https://worldwidetelescope.org/home).

The webclient is an [AngularJS] web app powered by the [WWT WebGL Engine]
JavaScript library.

## Building and Testing

In order to build and test the app, you need: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
specifically the `npm` command. If you need to install Node.js, use your
operating system’s package manager or visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
for installation instructions.

The first time you check out these files, run:

```
npm install
```

Once that has been done, you can build the website with:

```
npx grunt dist-dev
```

This will create the app files in the `dist` subdirectory of your repository
checkout. To test, all you need is a local HTTP file server pointing at that
subdirectory. We recommend:

```
npx http-server dist
```

This server (and most other static-file servers) will print out a URL that you
can visit to test out the web client locally.

There are also `dist-prod` and `dist-localtest` tasks that configure the build
slightly differently — consult the `profile-*.yml` files, especially
`profile-prod.yml`, to see the parameters that change. By creating a
`profile-localtest.yml` file derived from `profile-dev.yml`, you can monkey
with some low-level settings if you need to do so for testing purposes.


## Deployment

Merges to the `master` branch of this repository will be built and
automatically deployed to the testing version of the webclient:

### <https://worldwidetelescope.org/testing_webclient/>

The production webclient is updated by creating a new release, which is done
using [Cranko] workflows.
