# WWT-Web - WorldWide Telescope
WorldWide Telescope (WWT) enables you to explore the universe, bringing together imagery from the best ground- and space-based telescopes in the world and combining it with 3D navigation, data visualization, and more. Please see [WorldWideTelescope.org](http://worldwidetelescope.org/) for an overview.  The web client is currently available at [http://worldwidetelescope.org/webclient](http://worldwidetelescope.org/webclient).

This repository contains the following open source software: the HTML5 SDK which is the rendering engine for the WWT web client and the embeddable web control, and the full web client code. This repository does _not_ contain all the server-side endpoints needed to render tiles, constellation lines, etc. (Some samples will be included in the future.)
